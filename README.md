# Aaron Martin's Vim Configuration based on Derek Wyatt's Vim Configuration

I'm starting to root out and replace plug-ins and features I want from my Vim as compared to my screencasting hero.

To install it, do the following:

* Wipe out your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory (back up if you wish)
* `git clone https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config.git ~/.vim`
* `cd ~/.vim/bundle && ./get`
* `ln ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* Start Vim

Occassionally, the bundles may need updating.  To do this, `cd ~/.vim && ./update`
